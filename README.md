# Book_Donation_System
Created a new book doantion system - BOOKNETusing the programming language C ![book](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113010708/235695681-616e9dee-7164-4ecf-a7b6-81dba471368b.jpg)

Books are considered as the main sources of information since the very early time. As being profound reader myself, i have had the urge to constantly read books without the effort of puschasing too many books and giving the old, read ones out in the eagerness to pass the knowledge instilled in the books. 

1.1 OBJECTIVES of the modules - 
: To add, delete, update, search and display the information of the books as recieved or donated by the user. 
1.2 SCOPE of the project - 
: to be able to provide facilities for users to view and search different books alongiwith the donors and for the administrators to manage the database easily. 
1.3 MODULES -
: consists of *login authentication 
              *add
              *delete
              *update
              *search
              *display
It also asks the user for the personal details of the donor/reciever and to update the information about books on their portfolio. 
1.4 SOFTWARE USED - 
: We made it using the basic programming languages of C and with the visual studio code source code editor.



It purely had the simple intention of a college project, but i sometime soon seem to upgrade it with more backened and frontened part trying to develop into a fully responsive code.
